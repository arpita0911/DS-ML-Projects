2022-02-23,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"The worst McDonalds in central London, coming back here ONLY because I work next door. Twice came back with burgers hard as a stone - complained to the manager they never show a ""sorry attitude"" and staff being ignorant. I've been advised and reminded by my colleagues again to check the food before I leave today Â - the fries were not cooked inside - mash like coming out - broken in pieces - and oil - dry and dark from the outside! - when asked to exch them they Â again gave me the same horrible fries and I obviously said its no point so I waited a long time for the new fries. Why is that? I love fresh McDonald's",25/27 Shaftesbury Ave Piccadilly Circus London W1V 7HA United Kingdom,negative

2018-01-08,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"Located across the street from the Palace Theatre, this McDonald's was a lifesaver when I needed shelter from the pouring rain after walking over to see the home of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by rows of kiosks where you can put together your own order. I spent a while here trying to figure out if there was anything UK-specific that I should order, but I really wasn't in the mood for any food. I ended up ordering a toffee latte from the McCafe menu. With the kiosks, you can only pay with card, but there is a small counter on the left side if you need to order from an actual person and pay in cash. The receipt will have your order number and you just wait by the pick up counter for your order to be called. I will say that I got a little confused reading the receipt so they had to call my number a few times before I finally realised it was mine :PI did not take a good look around the entire McDonald's but I will say it did look pretty small with limited seating. I just took a counter seat looking out the window (at the Palace Theatre) until I was done with my drink, and then I left. The McDonald's seemed pretty clean to me when I was there and I have no complaints about this location. I feel like we all know what to expect for food and drink quality, but I will say that the toffee latte was pretty decent!",25/27 Shaftesbury Ave Piccadilly Circus London W1V 7HA United Kingdom,positive

2009-01-20,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"McDonalds can be found on your way out to Waterloo Road or shall I say, the uglier side of Waterloo Station. This branch can be quite evil for folks working in the area as they now accept credit and debit cards which will sway your more easily should you be undecided. There are a few sandwich shops in the area but let's face it, if it is gloomy outside we tend to want warm food and when McDonalds glare at you, you can't help but give in.Speaking of gloomy and cold, don't sit down to eat there unless you really have to because even though they've got heaters it still does not make it feel all warm and fuzzy. The building can be quite cold and you won't enjoy it properly.There is almost always a queue there but I have to admit, they do work it down quite quickly and the staff can be friendly at times, depending on how stressed they are. The cleaner always work double time at lunch hours to keep the place running smoothly.Oh by the way, there is a Barclays cash point around the corner if you wanted to pay by cash instead of using your card.",25/27 Shaftesbury Ave Piccadilly Circus London W1V 7HA United Kingdom,negative
2009-01-19,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"Unless you've been living in a cave, you must be familiar with McDonald's. The epitome of fast food restaurants - the one people think of when fast food is mentioned. They can be found in nearly every town centre, and every train station. And, as it happens, it's on in a train station I'm talking about here.If you go down the escalators from Waterloo Station towards the Jubilee Line, you'll find this ever so petite branch of McDonalds. With very little seating, and completely open plan, this is more a place to grab a very quick bite, perhaps even taking your food onto your train, rather than somewhere to bring the kiddies. There are no toilets (you need to pay 30p on Waterloo Station's concourse for that privilege), no play area and few seats. There is a counter with around five tills (so even when there is a queue, there is very rarely a wait), and behind you a little area where you can pick up napkins and utensils.Unlike Burger King upstairs, all the menu items are shown and priced (although the meal deals are given considerably more prominence than the 89p burger). McDonald's is cheaper than the Burger King upstairs, especially for basic items.I certainly wouldn't want to eat at McDonald's regularly. However, once in a while, if I've been in town lateish and so have skipped dinner, I'll pop down here for a quick and dirty cheeseburger. For that it is more than adequate.",25/27 Shaftesbury Ave Piccadilly Circus London W1V 7HA United Kingdom,neutral

2018-07-24,2023-09-15,McDonald's,I was highly impressed with their speed and service here especially considering how busy a place it's located in.

There are multiple self order touch screen stands here which takes standing in line out of the equation. I like the concept. You can scroll through the menu without getting the awkward stare from the cashier. The touch screen is responsive and everything is categorize so navigating to your desired item is not difficult at all. I ordered a shake on the touch screen, paid with my card and within minutes my number was called at the counter.There are multiple seating at this location.

2019-05-21,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"Located towards the end of Oxford Street, and the interchange with New Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, of which the Underground station is opposite, this McDonald's store was my point of call to grab a quick coffee before heading back to Euston to get a train home, as I received a coupon if I tried out the McDonald's ordering feature via their new mobile app.I ordered a standard latte, it once again took a while to be served like the previous time I tried the feature at the Ludgate Hill branch of the fast-food chain, when it was the staff just seemed rushed and unpleasant - which was a shame.My drink was for too milky even for a latte, the strong creaminess and sweetness was overpowering for the taste of the actual coffee.The overall feel of the store was again typical of McDonald's, not a lot of seating and modern features other than having many ordering stations where you use a touchscreen and payment card, as they try to push that onto customers.Bad drink quality and service warrant a one-star in my book.",8-10 Oxford Street London W1D 1AW United Kingdom,positive

I was hungry and had been drinking so thought anything would taste good, but sadly this was the worst McDonald's food I've ever had.The fries weren't cooked enough, the burger was cold and soggy as if it had been sat there a really long time and the milkshake was thin, not the usual so thick you can't suck it up the straw thickness. Perhaps it had been made up already and sat on the top melting.It seemed like a great idea at the time and I couldn't fault the convenience, speed or price, but I really regretted it as it wasn't the usual McDonald's standard. I don't expect gourmet or fine dining but I expect it to be cooked, hot (food) and cold (milkshake).",8-10 Oxford Street London W1D 1AW United Kingdom,positive

Not only are there usually more people queuing than there are eating in the 'restaurant' but they are just awful, they are metal, dirty and the sink area is shared with the men so the wait is twice as long!I am not doing justice to quite how bad they are, go look for yourself if you're in the area!!",8-10 Oxford Street London W1D 1AW United Kingdom,neutral
2019-04-22,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"McDonald's have four branches on London's Oxford Street, this is the second one I visited during my recent time in London, after the branch inside West One (a really poor, cramped store). This branch is located on 291B Oxford Street, in the Mayfair area of the street, it is a fairly tall, old and kind of impressive building, and is basically opposite John Lewis, and next to EE.The store is pretty clean for a Mcdonald's, there was a staff member who was cleaning up even though it was a little busy, they did get in the way slightly but at least the store was being constantly clean, which is something you don't often find in Mcdonald's locations, or in London.There was a decent amount of seating in the store also, but it is worth noting due to the central location on such a busy street (Oxford Street), it can get pretty busy, giving you a rushed feel.The store also offers McDelivery which is pretty handy if you live within 1.5 miles away, as they deliver via the UberEATS platform, which I find to be so much better to rivals including Deliveroo. (but that's a separate review!)Pretty much typical Mcdonald's store in terms of menu offerings, pretty cool building for a Mcdonald's and in a good location.3*",291B Oxford Street London W1C 2DT United Kingdom,positive
2022-07-09,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"**July 2022: Dinner Visit**Fast food usually isn't usually my preference when traveling; however, this McDonalds is directly across from the Palace Theater, which is where they show the Cursed Child (which is magical in every way and you must watch if visiting!). As I'm sure many theater patrons would agree the timing of a 1st Act (Methinks 2pm-5pm) and 2nd Act (7pm-9pm) act doesn't leave much room for travel and dinning especially if you're not familiar with the area.Nevertheless, this McDonalds had ample seating, clean open bathrooms (that did not require a key/bathroom code), and they had some unique items that differ from the offerings in the States. On my visit I went to the touch screen kiosk to select a few items which included a 9 piece chicken nugget with Sweet and Sour Sauce and an Indian Curry Sauce (which was pretty interesting) as well as a Tiramisu McFlurry. Both items came out pretty quick and considering the need to rush back to the theater it was just what I needed so my stomach didn't growl during the performance. Overall, this McDonalds is very convenient if you're in need of sustenance in a pinch!",68-69 St Martins Lane London WC2N 4JS United Kingdom,positive
2022-03-14,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"Probably one of the saddest McDonald's experienced I've ever had at a McDonalds.The main thing was that we came to eat here at about 1 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday night, and Sunday nights are famously dead in London. Come to find out it is the only location besides a local pizza restaurant that is open at this hour on a Sunday. So The place was completely packed with drunk people (I don't know where they got so drunk, everything was closed) and hungry people who had no other choice.We ended up waiting in line for McDonald's I remind you, and the wait it ended up being About 30 to 40 minutes. For some reason it was extremely slow that night. So slow that you could order online and walk in and get your order before you even moved in line. Unfortunately we are tourists and we don't have service around London because we're not willing to pay for it. So we had to wait with the rest of the people who couldn't order online and we felt like we were waiting for some exclusive club because of how long we had to wait and how serious the security was. They were two security guards Who seem to take their job very seriously and weren't polite in the slightest. Once we got in and ordered our food took about another 30 minutes of waiting before they finally brought the food to us. Also there were two police officers who they let in before anyone else, assuming because they were on duty but they still also had to wait 30 to 40 minutes just to get their food. What a waste of taxpayer pounds or however they pay their workers England.The food was of generally low quality, and it was definitely not worth spending over an hour and a half just to make a trip to McDonald's. Somewhere we're coming from America it's normally pretty fast and convenient. It was clear that no one in the kitchen really had a handle on it or a fire under their ass like they actually wanted to push food out. And they clearly prioritized whatever takeout orders or delivery orders were on fire, and didn't give two shits about the people queuing up to get in there. Awful experience and I won't be getting my time back, but it was fun to go just a think back and say ""remember when we went to McDonald's and had to wait an hour and a half just to get a shitty meal?""So yeah, if this is your only option on a Sunday night when it's late and nothing else is open, I suggest making a 40 to an hour minute walk to London bridge and just jumping off rather than waiting in line and getting rude service just to get a pile of garbage.Side note- also if it's busy, this McDonald's seems to just pour the drinks as soon as they come in and let them sit there and let the ice melt while they slowly collect your order with no sense of urgency.Terrible. Terrible! TERRIBLE!",68-69 St Martins Lane London WC2N 4JS United Kingdom,negative

The theatre insists you leave between the two parts and does not allow you to bring food into the theater.

The fries should be the same, for example, and maybe the difference is they have rice with chicken nuggets in Asia.Boy was I wrong. The food at this specific McDonald's was the most God-awful thing I've ever witnessed. The fries were disgustingly soggy and unseasoned. I made the mistake of experimenting with a Big and Tasty, which was ok when they used to have it on the menu in America, but wholly inedible here. Besides not coming with cheese (even though the picture had 2 slices of cheese FALSE ADVERTISING), it came with some sauce that I can only describe as a bastardized version of mayonnaise mixed with BBQ sauce. The bun itself was so dry that it cracked while I was trying to eat it and the disgusting sauce dripped out of the center of the bun, soaking my hands in all its horror.This tiny location also had 8 bar stool type seats, all filed, with some standing room only tables, that I had the misfortune of trying to eat at.",68-69 St Martins Lane London WC2N 4JS United Kingdom,negative

This game to Â£0.79.As a 24-7 store in central London which is located next to the Sainsbury's Local on Strand, the location and opening times are pretty handy, so must earn points for that, it is one of the few 24-7 Mcdonald's in London with many stores closing sometime in the early morning between 1 am and 3 am, London is a busy city that is always moving and busy so this store is pretty handy.The packaging was pretty wasteful for one carton of milk which equalled 250ml with a huge paper bag and multiple Mcdelivery stickers making it slightly hard to get into, which in my opinion is rather small compared to their other drinks, and at Â£0.79 for half a pint (250ml) of Arla Organic Milk this means 2L worth would cost Â£6.32 compared to the average price of Â£1.92 for Sainsbury's (Â£1.09 for regular supermarket own brand milk), it is pretty expensive in that sense but if you're just ordering because you've forgotten to buy it from the supermarket etc or to go with a meal it really isn't that bad.Convenient location and opening hours but the insanely wasteful packaging let it down.

Not only is this place the nicest + cleanest McDonald's I've been in AND open 24hrs (we had walked to a few others that were closed and were *devastated*) but the staff can handle hordes of drunk patrons - including foreigners like me who don't know the menu well - with ease.

2019-04-20,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"Located in the West One mall on Oxford Street, a small shopping centre on London's flagship shopping street, this is a tiny branch of McDonald's with only downstairs seating.In terms of decor, within reason, it is pretty much a typical Mcdonald's, baring inside it is a mall location and the fact it is really small, it seems to sell the full menu which I have photographed.The staff here didn't seem too friendly or helpful, quite typical of Mcdonald's and London, yet still pretty poor how they seemed to be robotic and unhelpful. Shame.The overall feel of the store was worsened because of the size, there was frankly not enough room to run the ordering and collecting stations, even during the week at an off-peak time (trust me London gets a hell of a lot busier), the store struggled to cope and it felt like one was queuing for Â a ticket for the afterlife at Armageddon, in great panic.If you're looking for a Mcdonald's while in the area, try to go to the one down the road with much more space, seating and slightly better service.1*",381 Oxford Street London W1C 2JS United Kingdom,neutral

2016-03-29,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"They've recently updated this location with the new touchscreens and collection counters. The only problem is that they haven't fixed the issues with the layout of the restaurant - so for example you now just needs a few slow people on those touchscreens and it totally backs up the ordering and causes the queue to go out the door. I know - I tried to visit the restaurant last week but couldn't because the queue was both out the door and unmoving. In other restaurants you could get to the front counter and order from there - technically you could here too, except that you wouldn't be able to get physically to the counter.Today was a little better, it was busy but even so only one of the screens was free. The upstairs was quite busy, but once I got downstairs it was verging on empty - I even managed to get an entire booth to myself. The food was much of a muchness - the same as you'd expect anywhere. Sadly the same issue remains with the touchscreens in that McDonald's burgers (at least those with cheese) were designed to sit on the counter for a couple of minutes to allow everything to come to temperature and for the cheese to melt. So as to be expected, my big mac was still odd as the cheese was far colder than the rest of the burger.It actually wouldn't take a lot to fix, just an investment in some cloches for each restaurant. Stick the cheese on the burgers while on the grill, squirt water around them, cover with the cloche and bingo, melted cheese in about five seconds. You still wouldn't get around the oddness of chilled salad inside a burger (I don't want my hot side hot and my cold side cold, I just want everything the same old lukewarm temp that I grew up with - leave your McDLT's in the past).I've been to better McDonalds, but the queues caused by the touchscreens being slower than speaking to a live person and causing the cluster in the entranceway of this restaurant loses it the third star.",155 Victoria Street Westminster SW1E 5NA United Kingdom,negative

The area does have lots of other good restaurants with a diverse option. We stopped by to eat dinner there the other night.I got the spicy chicken sandwich and omg that was my favorite! It was spicier than the one from the USA (a least to me). I got the grand big mac with bacon and it was disappointing. I got mine with bacon and it was so sad! It was not crispy at all, it looked like a piece of ham haha. The sauce was good but overall that flavor was not there. I did have to ask for ketchup because they did not have any at the counter.

By now, the outlet was less crowded, and we were in one quiet corner and in no one's way, making the call as it was quite noisy outside.Just when my husband finished the call, another security guy walked up to us and asked us if we can read the board at the door (which read ""only take way""). This itself was quite offending, but we patiently told him we had to urgently place a call to the bank and we were here to look for the card. To this he tells us that this is not a bank counter and we need to step out. All this while, the other security guy who knew why we were there didn't utter a word even though he knew our predicament. We just told off the guy quite sternly and walked out.This is terrible and unacceptable behavior towards people who are not creating any problem whatsoever.

But for this location, I don't know if they're short staffed because there were trash at every table. My friend and I sat at one that had the least amount of trash. Then saw this couple sat down at the other table after ordering food. That table had more trash so the lady just literally pushed all the trash to the side and half of it fell on the floor.

There are childrens areas for the children, newspapers available to read, and usually music in the background. All in all, quite a nice atmosphere.

Considering they look nothing alike and I requested grilled, with grilled being stated on a sticker which secured the box closed, and the bag, they knew it was grilled but included fried anyway?The restauraunt made no attempt to contact me, and despite phoning them eight times they wouldn't even speak to me about the order, I had to deal with Uber EATS who offered me a PARTIAL REFUND. Why should I have to pay Â£4.99 for a large fries? They still expected me to pay the high delivery and cost for something they refused to replace and I wouldn't have ordered without the wrap.The chips themselves were anaemic, they seemed to try and make up for that by overseasoning them and in all honesty, it just made the disgusting mess worse.The presentation was poor even for McDonald's standards, with no cutterly, napkins or seasoning in the bag, not that you needed the latter of course.A terrible branch of McDonald's and a disgrace to the chain together, sadly in my May 2019 trip this was one of three awful visits to the huge American fast food chain, and possibly the worst out of the lot, and even a one-star rating seems to be generous here.",201-217 Commercial Road London E1 2BT United Kingdom,negative

It did.I ordered up a chicken nugget meal with fries and a diet coke which was always my favorite as a kid in the states. The smell and taste of nuggets always had put a smile on my face then, and I was always overjoyed when my folks gave in and bought me a happy meal, which was not very often.I walked over to a seat by myself and chowed down. My first thought was hmm.. nuggets in England are really bland. Well I paid for it so I ate them and my fries. I even won a free cheeseburger with the Monopoly game they are currently running. Hurray!About ten minutes later I was stuffed and ready to continue my shopping for the day when suddenly a jolt in my stomach stopped me on the street ugh. Maybe I walked too fast after eating and got a cramp? Mild pains continued throughout the day. I was still full and so I skipped dinner that night but went for an evening walk, hoping to walk off the fat and grease I just consumed.When I was about 5 minutes away from my house.. that is when it hit me. I thought my intestines had ripped open and I wanted to fall to the floor and cry but I knew my fate was far worse. I needed a toilet and I needed it fast. So I ran home in a panicked sweat, fearing I was about to ruin a perfectly good pair of pantsDo you remember the scene in Dumb and Dumber when Harry accidently consumes all of those laxatives??? Well it was like that for a week and only yesterday have I had slight releif from it. I thought maybe it was food poison, maybe I got hepatitis or some other nasty disease. No.. I just damaged my poor digestive system and it will be a slow and painful recovery. I could probably even apply for disability benefits.Was it Mcdonalds? I know it was. Was this a necessary story to share? Probably not, but I tell everyone about my bowel movements so you were not spared. Could it happen to you? Possibly, but the fact that it even might, should discourage you. I may have just had a bad experience but never againI threw my free cheeseburger ticket in the trash hoping no one would pick it up and continue the vicious circle of intestinal desecration.

The fact this is one of the few stores in London not to accept mobile orders, which most McDonald's stores (even franchises) accept and try to push now, makes matters worse for me, as someone who hates waiting especially for something which could be done in seconds with technology.The staff as mentioned before seemed to really struggle, and they didn't seem to have a clue what they were doing, which on four visits to McDonald's on a recent trip to London, I found to be the case at 100% of branches, which includes branches at Ludgate Hill, Commercial Road, New Oxford Street and this one here at Westfield Stratford City.The location in a busy Food Court near other fast food rivals, as expected means the whole area can be pretty noisy, dirty and hard to get a table as McDonald's, of course, doesn't have its' own seating area.A poor branch of the American fast-food chain, even for food court standards.

I know they've done the same re-vamp everywhere but, although it's much more stylish, did they really need to choose a colour that looked like someone puked over the restaurant?

I have been interested to see them recently remodelling their restaurants and introducing a 99p menu and attempting to appear more healthy by offering fruit and salads.I tend towards their filet o' fish if I dine here and hot apple pie can be a nice snack.However, I am a bit mystified by this particular McDonalds, which is located on the busy A217 Sutton bypass. People drive to specifically buy McDonalds here and it's usually busy when I drive past.No wonder the UK has an obesity problem.",47/51 Oldfields Road Sutton SM1 2NB United Kingdom,positive

2009-10-12,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"Better Than Starving...justOk, so we all know this type of fast food isn't good for you but at least you expect it to be 'fast'.I frequent this branch of the Golden Arches more than I would like due to having children wanting their weekly treat of a Happy Meal. The drive-Thru is ALWAYS busy and you get to read the entire menu as you queue frustraitingly in line.Service is very poor, special orders are often wrongly supplied (no pickle in burger for example) and they ALWAYS FORGET THE DAMN KETCHUP! unless you ask.Priority seems to be given to the walk-in customers rather than the Drive-Thru customers. you end up waiting ages at the 'last window' watching as everyone and his mother gets served before you.There seems to be a high mechanical failure rate at this branch, one week there is no fizzy drinks, the next, there is no hot chocolate and they never seem to have enough special offer items left (like coke glasses).seven out of 10 visits I am asked to park in 'waiting bay 2' (bay one always seems busy with other hungry, frustrated customers)it's also annoying how when being asked to wait, they give you your drinks in advance, and by the time you get your order, the fizzy drinks are flat and water-diluted from the melting ice and your 'tripple thick' milkshake is like cat's wee (not that I've endulged)late night open hours- half the menu! yes folks, after 10pm if you ask for a deli of the day and a milkshake, you'll be given a nasty look and a short sharp no!WHY can't you have a milkshake or a deli of the day after this time?? has the cheif button pusher of the drinks dispenser gone home by then? and the 'Cordon blue' chef must live with him.Add to this the dirty car park, greasy window counter and staff with the personality of Frankinstein after a night out on the drink - I rate this MacDonalds a MINUS 5 but there's no way of rating that low.All told, if your not hungry, not in a hurry, not bothered about menu choice and don't mind having your wrongly supplied order hurled at you by Dracula,s bride then this is the place for you!oh, did I mention there's no milkshakes after 10pm? - COME ON RONALD SORT THIS PLACE OUT!",Horns Road London IG2 6BE United Kingdom,negative
2009-01-21,2023-09-15,McDonald's,Pros This McDonalds compared to others we've been to have good service. There are no long queues and don't have to wait very long to place your order. The best this I find about this place is that they have there own parking at the back and also a second one on Horns road (entry point for Toys r us). An added advantage is the play area at the back that has been made for children which works quite well and also a separate party room for children. It is a pleasant environment.Cons The negatives points are the cleanliness - They should work a little harder to clean the place up.,Horns Road London IG2 6BE United Kingdom,positive

In terms of location, it is quite ideal as it located towards the start (or the end, depending on where you are) of the high street and very close to the park incase you want to have a day out with the children.

2008-08-15,2023-09-15,McDonald's,"For a mcdonalds i would say this is one of the best. And to be honest that doesnt say much for maccy D's. They seem to have concentrated their efforts into trying to make the place look like a retro night club, rather than making their food edible. I am not really a fun of maccy d's - i have eaten it a few times but it does nothing for me. It is simply its ease of being 'fast' food that makes it more convienient at times.Emphasis on the fast here. Because they seem to have forgotten that part. On each occassion i have waited for at least 10 minutes for my food, to say there are so many staff standing around talking you would think they would bother to cook the food for customers. But then i suppose it means its 'fresh' now :| If that is possible. Stale chips and flat coke. When i ask for a still fanta i get either a fizzy fanta or a cup of water, because the machine isnt working. Rarely have the milkshake machine working too. Toilets are small and dirty - would not advise use. They do have a kiddie part, although it is so dark in there its hard to see what you are eating - or stepping on. Maybe thats the look they were going for, dont put any lights in there and it doesnt matter what the kids chuck on the floor?But to top it off, it has got to be the seecurity guard. Does that not just speak for todays society - bearing in mind oposite Maccy D's is Barkingside police station. They have to have a security guard on the door. And he asked my 11 year old cousin to leave, because he took TOO MANY STRAWS? WTF is that all about? Think the power has gone to his head.So although the food is rather rank - it does look nice from the outside :)",21 High Street Barkingside London IG6 2AW United Kingdom,negative
