# Pok√©mon Battle Prediction

This project predicts the **win probability** of Pok√©mon battles based on their stats and type matchups.  
Users can select a team of Pok√©mon, choose a fighter, and see a **ranked probability of winning** against a random opponent.

---

## Dataset

* Source: Custom Pok√©mon stats dataset (CSV) with the following columns:

  * **Name** ‚Äì Pok√©mon name  
  * **Type 1**, **Type 2** ‚Äì Primary and secondary types  
  * **HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed** ‚Äì Base stats  
  * **Total** ‚Äì Sum of all stats  
  * **Generation** ‚Äì Pok√©mon generation  
  * **Legendary** ‚Äì Boolean flag if Pok√©mon is legendary  

* Example entry:
```

Name,Type 1,Type 2,Total,HP,Attack,Defense,Sp. Atk,Sp. Def,Speed,Generation,Legendary
Bulbasaur,Grass,Poison,318,45,49,49,65,65,45,1,False

```

* Missing Type 2 values were replaced with `"None"` for consistency.

## Win Probability Prediction

The project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict the probability of a Pok√©mon winning a battle.

### Steps:

1. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Stat differences (`Attack vs Defense`, `Speed difference`)  
   - Type effectiveness scores  
   - Total stats  

2. **Model Training:**  
   - Train-test split (80%-20%)  
   - Logistic Regression from `scikit-learn`  

3. **Evaluation:**  
   - Accuracy: ~93-94%  
   - Confusion matrix and classification report  

4. **Battle Simulation:**  
   - Users pick 5 Pok√©mon  
   - Random opponent is selected  
   - Users choose a fighter  
   - Model outputs **probabilities for all team members**  
   - Ranked probabilities indicate the best choice

## Example Output

```

Opponent Pok√©mon: Jellicent
Chosen Pok√©mon: Charmander
That‚Äôs a really bad matchup.

\---------- Battle Results ----------

1. Bulbasaur: 98.34%  ‚Üí ‚úÖ Excellent pick
2. Pikachu: 42.51%    ‚Üí ü§î Risky pick
3. Butterfree: 2.01%  ‚Üí ‚ùå Bad pick
4. Rattata: 0.01%     ‚Üí ‚ùå Bad pick
5. Charmander: 0.00%  ‚Üí ‚ùå Bad pick

Comparing stats: Charmander vs Jellicent
